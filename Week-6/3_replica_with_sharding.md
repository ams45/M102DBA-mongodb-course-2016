#Replication with sharding
 - Replication Factor 
 - if one doc is present in shard, it will be replicate in multiple replicas
 - if there are 20M doc
   - and 20 shards
   - then each shard hav 5 M docs
   - each replica in shard has 5M docs.
 - its depends on how many replica we want.
 - its not good to have only one.
